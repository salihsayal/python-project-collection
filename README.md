# 🐍 Python Projects – Learning by Building

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects I'm building while following the [Python Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to deepen my understanding of Python by applying concepts through practical coding challenges and projects. I'm focusing on everything from foundational programming to web development, automation, and beyond.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository is a standalone project, often inspired by or aligned with milestones on the Python roadmap. Projects are grouped by topic or learning goal.

```bash
python-project-collection
├── apis
├── automation
├── cli-tools
│   ├── github-activity
│   │   └── github-activity
│   └── task-cli
│       └── task-cli
├── README.md
└── web-app
```

## 📌 Current Focus Areas

- ✅ Python basics & syntax
- ✅ Scripting & automation
- ⏳ Working with APIs
- ⏳ Web development (Flask, FastAPI)
- ⏳ Testing & debugging
- ⏳ Data handling (Pandas, JSON, CSV)

_(This list grows as I progress through the roadmap.)_

## 🧠 Learning Sources

This repository is part of my structured learning journey, combining hands-on coding with trusted resources:

- 🛣️ [roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python)  
  My main guide for structuring what to learn and in what order.

- 📘 [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
  The authoritative source for Python syntax, built-in features, and standard libraries.

- ⚡ [Learn Python in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)  
  A fast, minimalist walkthrough of Python syntax — great for quick reviews or learning patterns.

- 💬 [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)  
  For resolving specific issues, understanding error messages, and learning from community answers.

- 🌐 [W3Schools – Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)  
  Helpful for quick lookups, syntax reminders, and beginner-friendly examples.

- 🧠 [GeeksforGeeks – Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/)  
  Useful for algorithm explanations, coding patterns, and deeper topic overviews.

This mix of structured roadmaps, official docs, syntax guides, and community Q&A helps me balance fundamentals with practical coding experience.
