# 🐍 Python Projects – Learning by Building

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects I'm building while following the [Python Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to deepen my understanding of Python by applying concepts through practical coding challenges and projects. I'm focusing on everything from foundational programming to web development, automation, and beyond.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository is a standalone project, often inspired by or aligned with milestones on the Python roadmap. Projects are grouped by topic or learning goal.

## 📌 Current Focus Areas

- ✅ Python basics & syntax
- ✅ Scripting & automation
- ⏳ Working with APIs
- ⏳ Web development (Flask, FastAPI)
- ⏳ Testing & debugging
- ⏳ Data handling (Pandas, JSON, CSV)

_(This list grows as I progress through the roadmap.)_

## 🧠 Learning Source

All project ideas and learning topics are based on:

📚 [roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python)  
🔗 Additional documentation from:  
- [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
