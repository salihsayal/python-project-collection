# 🐍 Python Projects – Learning by Building

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects I'm building while following the [Python Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to deepen my understanding of Python by applying concepts through practical coding challenges and projects. I'm focusing on everything from foundational programming to web development, automation, and beyond.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repository is a standalone project, often inspired by or aligned with milestones on the Python roadmap. Projects are grouped by topic or learning goal.

│   ├── todo-app/
│   └── calculator/
├── web-dev/
│   ├── flask-blog/
│   └── api-with-fastapi/
├── automation/
│   ├── file-renamer/
│   └── web-scraper/


## 📌 Current Focus Areas

- ✅ Python basics & syntax
- ✅ Scripting & automation
- ⏳ Working with APIs
- ⏳ Web development (Flask, FastAPI)
- ⏳ Testing & debugging
- ⏳ Data handling (Pandas, JSON, CSV)

_(This list grows as I progress through the roadmap.)_

## 🧠 Learning Sources

This repository is built as part of my structured journey to learn Python by doing, with guidance from curated learning resources:

- 🛣️ [roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python)  
  Provides the big-picture structure for what to learn and in what order.

- 📘 [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)  
  My go-to reference for language syntax, built-in functions, modules, and best practices.

- ⚡ [Learn Python in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)  
  A fast, concise language tour — perfect for refreshing syntax or discovering neat tricks.

This mix of high-level guidance, deep reference material, and quick-syntax reviews helps me balance structured progression with hands-on practice.
